    "This project is designed to test people's understanding of the Coronavirus and provide them with certain statistics about the coronavirus. The main purpose of this project is to see if individuals are intelectually prepared to tackle the virus and help equips them with certain important facts and stats about the virus.\n",
    "The project has two main subsections- A quiz and a database\n",
    "\n",
    "The quiz contains of 10 questions about the coronavirus, how it is spread, its symptooms, etc. The asseses how prepared individuals are and gives them advice based on their performance. The quiz feature will end once all questions have been answered \n",
    "\n",
    "The database contains 4 different datasets about the coronavirus in the United States, which are - Weekly case in the US, weekly deaths in the US, distribution according to age group, and finally a bunch of global statistics about the virus. The database interface wil shut down when the user types 'end' in the input option\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these two interfaces are heavily input based and responds differently to different inputs made by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project begins with an initial input based function that allows the user to choose between accessing the quiz or the database. To switch between these two, the cell containng the initial function has to be rerun after the initial run has completely ended. \n",
